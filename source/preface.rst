Preface
=======

The Development of Embedded Systems is a challenge for all trades:
Electrical Engineers, Operating System developer, application developer and
product management deal with a complex and highly abstracted system.

This document provides requirements for the hardware most Embedded Systems that
ease on hardware comissioning, operating system development and
continuous testing.

This document is divided into two mayor sections:
The first section provides an overall insight on how embedded operating system
development works and thus gives the basics to understand the importance of the
requirements given in the second section.
